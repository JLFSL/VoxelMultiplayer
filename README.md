### Voxel Tycoon Multiplayer
VT:MP is a multiplayer modification for the game called "Voxel Tycoon". Created for fun.

VT:MP is in no way affiliated with the developers of VoxelTycoon.

## Current Status

The modification is still in development. A basic connection between host and client (p2p), multiplayer menu and very early prop synchronization is implemented at this time.
Almost 90% of the time I'm working on this project is focused on researching on how the game works and how to be able to synchronize various parts of the game.

Don't expect too much at the moment, but any contributions to the code are welcome.
