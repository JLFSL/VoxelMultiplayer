### Voxel Tycoon Multiplayer
VT:MP is a multiplayer modification for the game called "Voxel Tycoon". Created for fun.

VT:MP is in no way affiliated with the developers of VoxelTycoon.

## Current Status

The modification is still in development. A basic connection between host and client (p2p), multiplayer menu and very early prop synchronization is implemented at this time.
Almost 90% of the time I'm working on this project is focused on researching on how the game works and how to be able to synchronize various parts of the game.

Don't expect too much at the moment, but any contributions to the code are welcome.
  
## Playing
As how promising it may have been, for now there is no way to play with other players over the internet. This is only possible on one computer which runs two instances of the game. As the modification is unplayable with another player at this time, I've decided to keep the project in a debugging environment until the project gets far enough for 2 or more players to play together.
  
## Building
Should be pretty straight forward. Add the missing references for the client project and it should build on the latest compatible version of Voxel Tycoon. (v0.86)
  
The launcher asks whether you wish to start a server **and** client instance, if this is the case then enter 'y'. Otherwise just press enter to continue and only start a server instance.

  Your folder structure should look like this if you wish to start two instances. The library files are not in this picture, but the only changes are a copy of _VoxelTycoon.exe_ named _VoxelTycoon2.exe_ and a copy of _/VoxelTycoon_Data_ named _/VoxelTycoon2_Data_
